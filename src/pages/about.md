Hi, Iâ€™m Wonseok ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software developer with a hands-on approach to learning and building. I enjoy working across the stack \- from designing backend APIs and infrastructure to experimenting with machine learning models and game engines.

Lately, my projects revolve around containerized development (Devcontainers, Docker), cloud-native infrastructure (FastAPI + PostgreSQL + Redis + Milvus + SeaweedFS, running on Kubernetes), and practical ML (like contrastive fine-tuning of DistilBERT for sentiment analysis). I also like building dev tools, writing automation scripts, and figuring out how things actually work under the hood.

Outside of backend systems, Iâ€™m also working on a multiplayer card game using LÃ–VE2D

This blog is where I document what Iâ€™m learning, share experiments, and write the kind of guides I wish existed. Whether youâ€™re a fellow developer, a curious student, or someone reviewing my portfolio â€” thanks for dropping by!
